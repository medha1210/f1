F1 analysis : This project aims to analyze the patterns and the performance between different drivers.
The SQL script analyzes and compares the performance of Verstappen and Hamiltion, by comparing their total races and total points, fastest laps by track, average lap time by track and average lap time season wise to see if there has been an improvement over the years.
Furthermore, it calculates the "pole-conversion-rate" which is esentially the number of times the pole position winners end up winning the actual race.
It also compares different tracks based on the average lap times and briefly discusses the team performaces by calculating team points and number of times a team has qualified for a race through either of its drivers.
Then some of the findings have been visualized using PowerBI!
